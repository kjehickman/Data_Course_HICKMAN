**Bolded Text**
Articles on Git's site aren't always clear about application methods. Perhpas adding '#' to make a heading doesn't work for .md files.
This is an explicit acknowledgment that the first three times I attempted a commit I didn't enter a password, so the 5th commit is technically the 8th commit.
Here I'm going to attempt a paragraph break.

This line should be a new paragraph.
*This line should be Italicized.*
~~This is a Strikethrough phrase.~~
**If all of the _other_ commands are working properly, then why hasn't the _heading_ formatting worked.
#This should be a heading.
**This should be bolded (for real this time.)**
# Is this a heading?

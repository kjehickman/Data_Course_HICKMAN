2. For my final project I would like to work with the data sets from Lee et al. 2019, Lee et al. 2020, and the dataset for the paper we're currently working on. Hopefully I can analyze the data to see if there are any interactions or significant associations / correlations between fungi and bacteria that may impact the fitness of mangroves. For example, correlation in various fungal / bacterial species to plant part may infer a deeper relationship.

3. The data is from a genomic analysis of mangrove associated fungi and bacteria in Southeast Asia. There will also be details on location, in addition to the class/genus/species data that we can extract from sequencing analysis. The datasets form the analysis are found on the National Center for Biotechnology Information under the BioProject ID PRJNA592423 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA592423) and Accession PRJNA545581 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA545581), and is in the form of raw sequence reads. I will get the third data set form your Github account..?

4. Since I don't have very expansive knowledge on how to get to the classifications from raw data and sequencing yet, I'm creating a fake data set to show class / genus correlation to plant parts.

5. My ggplot can be accessed form running the code in the .R file uploaded to Github.
